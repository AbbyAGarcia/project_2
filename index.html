        <h2> About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello world. My name is Abby A. Garcia. I like to describe myself as a jack of all trades master of none, yet.</p>
    <p>I attended GCE Lab High School ( a project based learning school), and came into IIT wanting to become a particle physicist.</p>
          <p>Due to financial reasons, I decided ITM was a more viable career option and aim to obtain my CompTIA+ & Network+ certification by the end of my third year.</p>
          <p>Recently, law school has entered my radar and by mixing my tech background with law I hope to become an intellectual property lawyer.</p>
    <p>These are my hobbies: reading, writing, doing physics for fun, music, video games, and ending up in the most random adventures.</p>
